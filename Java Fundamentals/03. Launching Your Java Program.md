##  Launching Your Java Program
### Learning Objective:
- Learn how to create, compile, and run your first Java program using the command line and understand the structure of a basic Java class.

#### Let's Get Started!
Now that we’ve been introduced to how Java works, it’s time to actually start coding. Our first project will be a simple one, but it will introduce some important concepts about Java’s structure and how to get your code up and running.

Let's create your **first Java program!**
- First, create a folder for your project. Inside your usual coding folder (e.g., ArmadaTraining/java-assignments), make a new folder called: Greetings.
- Now, open this folder in your text editor or IDE, and create a file named: HelloWorld.java

*Note: File names in Java must start with a capital letter and match the class name exactly.*

#### Writing Your First Java File
Inside HelloWorld.java, type this basic structure:
```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
    }
}
```
This is the **minimum structure** needed to run a Java program.

#### What Is the *main* Method?
Every Java application starts with the main method. Think of it as the entry point or launchpad for your code.
```java
public static void main(String[] args)
```
We’ll explore what all those words mean later, but for now, just remember:
- All Java code must live inside a class
- The main method is where your program starts executing

#### Naming Rules in Java
Before you get too deep into coding, here are two key naming rules to remember:

- **File and Class Names Must Match**
Your file name (HelloWorld.java) and your class name (public class HelloWorld) must be identical. If they don’t match, the program won’t compile.

- **Use PascalCase for Class Names**
Class names should use PascalCase:
- Start with an uppercase letter
- Capitalize the start of each word.
    *Examples: BankAccount, StudentGrades, MyFirstProgram*

#### Let’s Print Something!

Now let’s make the program actually do something. Let’s print "Hello World!" to the terminal:
```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}
```
This line:
```java
System.out.println("Hello World!");
```
…tells Java to print text to the console. It ends with a semicolon—which is required in Java to mark the end of a statement.
>  In Java, forgetting semicolons is a common beginner error!

Alright, let us now compile and run your code, So, Java doesn’t run code directly from .java files. You need to compile it first.

**Steps to Run Your Program via Terminal:**
1. Compile the code:
    ```nginx
    javac HelloWorld.java
    ```
2. If there are no errors, a file named Test.class will appear in your folder. This is your bytecode.
3. Run the compiled bytecode:
    ```nginx
    java HelloWorld
    ```
    *You do not type java Test.class—just java Test*
4. If everything worked, you should see:
    ```nginx
    Hello World!
    ```

#### Mantra of the Day: “Every Change = Recompile”
Whenever you make changes to your Java file, you must recompile it before you can run the latest version.
> Remember: Write Code - Compile *(javac)* - Run *(java)*.

#### Try It Yourself
1. Create a new file called Welcome.java
2. Write a program that prints:
    ```css
    Welcome to Java Programming!
    ```
3. Compile and run it.
### In Summary
- Java code goes in .java files.
- Every program starts from the main method.
- You must compile your file before running it.
- The file name and class name must match.
- Java requires semicolons to end statements.
