## Java OOP Overview
#### Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- **Understand** the basic principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
- **Implement** OOP concepts in Java through classes, objects, constructors, and access modifiers.
- **Apply** encapsulation, static methods, and object interactions in their own programs.

Object-Oriented Programming (**OOP**) is a paradigm that organizes software design around **objects** rather than actions, and **data** rather than logic.

* Think of it as **modeling the real world in code**.
* Instead of just writing functions and variables, we group them into **objects** that represent real-world entities.

#### Why OOP?

* Makes code **modular** (organized into components).
* Increases **reusability** (write once, use many times).
* Improves **maintainability** (easier to debug and modify).
* Encourages **clearer thinking** when solving complex problems.

Java was **built** with OOP in mind—**everything revolves around objects**.

#### Core Concepts of OOP in Java

- **Classes and Objects**
    - **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects.
    - **Object**: An instance of a class with its own data and behavior.

    *Example:*

    ```java
    class Car {
        String brand;
        int year;

        void startEngine() {
            System.out.println(brand + " engine started.");
        }
    }

    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Car myCar = new Car(); // Create an object
            myCar.brand = "Toyota";
            myCar.year = 2020;
            myCar.startEngine();
        }
    }
    ````

- Constructors
    - Special methods used to **initialize objects**.
    - Have the same name as the class.
    - Can be **overloaded** to accept different parameters.

    *Example:*

    ```java
    class Car {
        String brand;
        int year;

        Car(String b, int y) {
            brand = b;
            year = y;
        }
    }
    ```

- **Encapsulation *(Access Modifiers)***
    - Encapsulation = **hiding the internal details** and exposing only what’s necessary.
    - Achieved using **access modifiers**:
        - `public`: Accessible everywhere.
        - `private`: Accessible only within the class.
        - `protected`: Accessible within the same package and subclasses.
        - **Default**: Accessible only within the same package.

    *Example:*

    ```java
    class BankAccount {
        private double balance;

        public void deposit(double amount) {
            balance += amount;
        }
        
        public double getBalance() {
            return balance;
        }
    }
    ````

- **Object Interaction**

    Objects can interact with each other by calling methods or passing data.

    *Example:*

    ```java
    class Engine {
        void start() {
            System.out.println("Engine started.");
        }
    }

    class Car {
        Engine engine = new Engine();
        void startCar() {
            engine.start();
        }
    }
    ```

- **Static Members**

    - **Static methods/variables** belong to the class rather than a specific object.
    - Can be accessed without creating an instance.

    *Example:*

    ```java
    class MathHelper {
        static int square(int num) {
            return num * num;
        }
    }

    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println(MathHelper.square(5));
        }
    }
    ```

#### Summary
- **Classes** define the blueprint; **objects** are the instances.
- **Constructors** initialize objects.
- **Encapsulation** protects data using access modifiers.
- **Objects** interact by calling each other’s methods.
- **Static members** belong to the class, not the object.

Mastering OOP in Java helps you:

* Write **cleaner, more maintainable** code.
* Build **scalable applications**.
* Think **like a software engineer**, not just a coder.
