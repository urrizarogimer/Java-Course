## Switch Statements and Ternary Operators
#### Learning Objectives:
- Learn how to use switch statements to handle multiple conditions
- Understand the structure and syntax of a switch block
- Use the ternary operator to write more concise conditional expressions

In Java, we often rely on if and else statements to make decisions. But when you are checking a single variable against multiple fixed values—such as days of the week, menu options, or user input codes—switch statements can be a cleaner alternative.

Let’s consider the following example:
```java
int day = 2;

switch(day) {
    case 1:
        System.out.println("Monday");
        break;
    case 2:
        System.out.println("Tuesday");
        break;
    case 3:
        System.out.println("Wednesday");
        break;
    case 4:
        System.out.println("Thursday");
        break;
    case 5:
        System.out.println("Friday");
        break;
    case 6:
        System.out.println("Saturday");
        break;
    case 7:
        System.out.println("Sunday");
        break;
    default:
        System.out.println("There are only seven days in a week...");
}
```

#### How *switch* works
1. We begin with the **switch** keyword, followed by a variable inside parentheses—this is the value being compared.
2. Each **case** is followed by a value to match. If the value matches the variable, the corresponding code block executes.
3. The **break** keyword tells Java to exit the switch block once a match is found. Without it, execution will "fall through" to the next case, often causing unintended behavior.
4. The **default** case acts like the else in an if-else chain—it handles any value that doesn’t match any case above it.

#### Ternary Operator: A Shorter Way to Make Decisions
There are times when writing an entire if-else block feels too long, especially when you're just choosing between two values. In these situations, the ternary operator offers a more compact solution.

Here’s the traditional way:
```java
boolean isRaining = true;

if (isRaining) {
    System.out.println("Bring an umbrella.");
} else {
    System.out.println("Have fun!");
}
```

Here’s the same logic using the ternary operator:
```java
condition ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse
```

It reads:
“If the condition is true, return the first value. Otherwise, return the second.”
It doesn’t replace full control flow logic, but it’s perfect for quick, binary decisions.

Example: Switch with Ternary
The following code demonstrates both concepts working together:
```java
public class SwitchAndTernary {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int goals = 3;
        boolean watchReplay = false;

        System.out.println("Are we watching this?");

        switch(goals) {
            case 0:
                System.out.println("Sounds like a boring game.");
                break;
            case 1:
                System.out.println("Was it a good goal?");
                watchReplay = true;
                break;
            case 2:
                System.out.println("Was it a tie?");
                watchReplay = true;
                break;
            case 3:
                System.out.println("I can't wait to see it!");
                watchReplay = true;
                break;
            default:
                System.out.println("More than 3 goals? I'm in!");
                watchReplay = true;
        }

        System.out.println(watchReplay ? "I'll see you in a bit." : "I'll pass.");
    }
}
```
Before running the code, try to predict what it will print. Then, modify the goals value and observe how the output changes.

#### Summary
- Use switch statements to simplify code when checking one variable against multiple fixed values.
- Always include break after each case unless you intentionally want execution to fall through.
- Use default to catch unmatched values.
- Use the ternary operator when you want to make a quick decision between two values based on a condition.
