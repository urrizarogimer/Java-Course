## How Does Java Works?
### Learning Objective:
- Understand the process of how Java code is written, compiled, and executed using the Java Development Kit (JDK) and Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

Java is known for its **"Write Once, Run Anywhere"** capability. But how exactly does that work?

Unlike some languages that compile directly to machine code, Java takes a different approach. It uses a **two-step process**: compilation and interpretation. This is what makes Java platform-independent.

### The Java Program Life Cycle
Letâ€™s break down what happens when you write and run a Java program:

- **Write your code** in a file that ends with .java.
    - *Example: HelloWorld.java*
- **Compile the code** using the javac command. This turns your source code into bytecode, which is saved in a .class file.
    - *Example: javac HelloWorld.java produces HelloWorld.class*
- **Run the bytecode** using the java command. The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) reads the bytecode and executes it.

### Try It Yourself!
Create a file named TestJava.java and write this code:
```java
public class TestJava {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Java is working!");
    }
}
```
Compile and run it in your terminal or IDE.
