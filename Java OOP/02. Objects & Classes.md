## Objects and Classes

#### Learning Objective:
- Understand the relationship between **classes** and **objects** and how they form the foundation of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is centered around the concept of **objects**.

* An **Object** represents a real-world entity or concept.
* An object has:

  * **Fields (attributes/properties):** store data about the object.
  * **Methods (behaviors/actions):** define what the object can do.

Objects are created from **Classes**, which act as **blueprints**.

Think of a **Class** as a template and an **Object** as an actual thing built from that template.

#### Here is a Real-World Analogy

Imagine modeling a **Solar System**:

* **Planet Class (blueprint):**

  * Fields: `mass`, `rotationSpeed`, `currentPosition`
  * Methods: `determineNewPosition()`

* **Planet Objects (instances):**

  * Earth → mass = 5.97 × 10²⁴ kg, rotationSpeed = 1670 km/hr
  * Mars → mass = 6.39 × 10²³ kg, rotationSpeed = 868 km/hr

Each planet is unique but created from the same **class**.

#### Syntax in Java

**Defining a Class**

```java
public class Greeter {
    // Fields (Attributes)
    String message;

    // Method (Behavior)
    void greet() {
        System.out.println(message);
    }
}
```

#### Creating Objects from a Class

```java
public class GreeterTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating an object from Greeter class
        Greeter g1 = new Greeter();
        g1.message = "Hello, World!";
        g1.greet();   // Output: Hello, World!

        Greeter g2 = new Greeter();
        g2.message = "Welcome to Java!";
        g2.greet();   // Output: Welcome to Java!
    }
}
```
Key Points:
- `Greeter` is the class (blueprint).
- `g1` and `g2` are objects (instances).
- Each object stores **its own data** and can perform **its own actions**.

#### Naming Conventions
- Classes → use **PascalCase** (e.g., `Student`, `Car`, `Greeter`)
- Objects/variables → use **camelCase** (e.g., `myCar`, `student1`)
- Only **one `public` class** is allowed per file, and its name must match the filename.

#### Summary

- **Classes** are blueprints for objects.
- **Objects** are unique instances created from classes.
- Each object has **fields** (data) and **methods** (behavior).
- Java follows strict **naming conventions** for classes and files.
