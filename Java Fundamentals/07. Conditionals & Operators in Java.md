# Conditionals and Operators
### Learning Objectives:
- Understand control flow using *if, else if, and else statements*
- Learn how to use comparison and logical operators in Java
- Differentiate between the assignment operator and comparison operators

In real life, we often make decisions based on conditions. Programming works the same way, **conditionals** allow a program to choose different paths depending on the situation. In Java, the most basic way to express this is through the if statement. You can use it to tell your program: **“If this condition is true, do this.”**

The basic syntax looks like this:
```java
if (condition) {
    // code that runs if the condition is true
}
```
For example:
```java
boolean isRaining = true;

if (isRaining) {
    System.out.println("Bring an umbrella.");
}
```
