## Jarvis Assistant – Your Personal AI Butler
### Learning Objectives
By the end of this activity, students will be able to:
- Implement and call Java methods in a modular program
- Separate functionality into multiple files (modularization)
- Use `java.util.Date` to work with date and time
- Utilize `String` methods such as `format`, `indexOf`, and `equalsIgnoreCase`
- Apply conditional control structures for decision-making
- Practice method overloading for more flexible method behavior

### Difficulty: Beginner–Intermediate
*(Requires knowledge of Java basics, String manipulation, and methods)*

### Estimated Time of Completion: 1.5 - 2 hrs
### Instructions

Tony Stark is upgrading **J.A.R.V.I.S.** *(Just A Rather Very Intelligent System)* to be more conversational. You’ve been hired to program Jarvis so he can greet people, announce the current date, and respond intelligently to certain keywords.

You will create **two Java files**:

1. **JarvisAssistant.java** – contains all Jarvis methods (logic implementation)
2. **JarvisTest.java** – contains the `main` method for testing Jarvis’ responses

**Step 1: Create JarvisAssistant.java**

* Implement the following methods:

  1. **basicGreeting()** – Returns a default greeting.
     Example: `"Greetings, Sir. How may I assist you today?"`
  2. **guestGreeting(String name)** – Returns a personalized greeting using the guest’s name.
     Example: `"Hello, Pepper Potts. How may I assist you?"`
  3. **dateAnnouncement()** – Returns the current date and time.
     Example: `"Sir, it is currently Tue Aug 5 09:45:12 PST 2025."`
  4. **respondBeforeFriday(String conversation)** – Respond differently if the conversation mentions **"Friday"** or **"Jarvis"**.

     * If contains `"Friday"` → `"Right away, Sir. Although she’s still learning."`
     * If contains `"Jarvis"` → `"At your service, Sir."`
     * Else → `"Very well. Carrying on."`

**Step 2: Create JarvisTest.java**

* Create an instance of `JarvisAssistant`
* Call and print results for each method
* Test with sample conversations


**Step 3: Bonus Challenges**

* Overload `guestGreeting` to also accept a **dayPeriod** parameter: `"morning"`, `"afternoon"`, `"evening"`
  Example: `"Good evening, Pepper Potts. How may I assist you?"`

* Create a version of `guestGreeting()` that determines the time of day automatically using `Date` and `SimpleDateFormat`.

**Extra Creative Bonus** 

* Add a method `jarvisMood(String mood)` that changes Jarvis’ tone based on mood (`"angry"`, `"cheerful"`, `"tired"`) using String methods like `.toUpperCase()` or `.toLowerCase()`.
