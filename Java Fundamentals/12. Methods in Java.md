## Java Methods

#### Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Declare and define methods in Java
- Understand method signatures and how they work
- Apply method overloading to create flexible method definitions

#### What Are Methods?

In Java (and other object-oriented languages), a **method** is a block of code that performs a task — just like a **function** in other languages. But here’s the key difference:

In Java, functions are always tied to **classes**, so they are called **methods**.

You’ll never write a stand-alone function in Java. Every method belongs to a class — even your `main()` method.

#### Defining a Method in Java

Here’s a simple example of a Java method:

```java
public String guestGreeting(String name, String dayPeriod) {
    return "Good " + dayPeriod + ", " + name + ". Welcome!";
}
```

Let’s break it down:

* `public`: Access modifier (we'll explore this more soon)
* `String`: Return type — this method returns a String
* `guestGreeting`: Method name
* `(String name, String dayPeriod)`: Parameters (input values)


#### Method Signatures

A method **signature** uniquely identifies a method and consists of:

1. The method name
2. The number and types of parameters

For example:

```java
public void coolMethodName(int count, String label)
```

The signature here is:

```
coolMethodName(int, String)
```

Java uses these signatures to differentiate between methods, especially when **overloading**.

#### Method Overloading

**Method overloading** means creating multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.

Example:

```java
public String guestGreeting(String name) {
    return "Hello, " + name;
}

public String guestGreeting(String name, String dayPeriod) {
    return "Good " + dayPeriod + ", " + name;
}
```

Depending on how you call `guestGreeting()`, Java will choose the correct version based on the argument types and number of parameters.

This is a powerful feature that allows flexibility without needing to come up with new method names.

#### Try It Yourself

Use the code below and test method overloading in action.

Code Exercise: `Methods.java`

```java
public class Methods {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        // Try calling both versions of the greeting method
        System.out.println(greeting("Sam"));
        System.out.println(greeting("Rick", "Jones"));
    }

    // Method #1: Accepts one parameter
    public static String greeting(String name){
        return String.format("Hello %s, how are you today?", name);
    }

    // Method #2: Accepts two parameters
    public static String greeting(String firstName, String lastName){
        return String.format("Hello %s %s, how are you today?", firstName, lastName);
    }
}
```

#### What to Do:

* Run the program.
* Try adding a third overloaded method that includes a day of the week.
* Observe which method is called based on your arguments.

#### Summary

* In Java, methods are similar to functions but must be part of a class.
* A method has a signature that includes its name and the types of its parameters.
* You can overload methods by creating multiple versions of the same method name with different parameter types or counts.
* Method overloading allows you to write cleaner, more intuitive code.
* Practicing method declarations and overloads is essential for writing maintainable and scalable Java programs.
