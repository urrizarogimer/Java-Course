## Pizza Palace Order System

#### Learning Objective/s:
- Practice using variables and data types to represent real-world information
- Use conditionals and arithmetic operations to calculate total prices
- Simulate interaction between a business and customers
- Encounter and debug common syntax issues in Java

#### Difficulty: Beginner
#### Estimated Time of Completion: 30–45 minutes

#### Instructions:
You will build the basic logic for a pizza ordering system called Pizza Palace. This system will use variables to manage menu items, customer information, and order statuses.

1. Set Up the App:
Create a file named PizzaPalace.java. Inside, create a main method and declare the following string variables for app messages:
    - welcomeMessage
    - pendingMessage
    - readyMessage
    - displayTotalMessage
2. Menu Variables:
Declare price variables (double) for the following items:
    - Pepperoni Pizza: $8.99
    - Veggie Pizza: $9.49
    - Cheese Pizza: $7.99
3. Customer Variables:
Create string variables for the following customers:
    - Anna
    - Mark
    - Lisa
    - Kevin
4. Order Status Flags:
Create boolean variables for each customer's order status. Use names like *isOrderReadyAnna*, *isOrderReadyMark*, etc.

#### App Simulation Logic:
Using the variables you’ve set up, complete the following scenarios:

1. Greet Anna:
Anna ordered a Pepperoni Pizza. Print a greeting and the pending or ready message depending on her order status.
2. Mark’s Total:
Mark ordered 2 Cheese Pizzas. Print the total. Then, using an if statement, check if his order is ready and print the appropriate message.
3. Lisa’s Order:
Lisa ordered a Veggie Pizza. Use an if-else block to check her order status and print either the pending or ready message, including the total if ready.
4. Kevin’s Correction:
Kevin was charged for a Cheese Pizza but ordered a Veggie Pizza. Calculate and display the difference he needs to pay.

#### Extension (Optional):
Try changing the values of the menu prices and order statuses to test your logic. Make sure your messages and totals still print correctly under different conditions.
