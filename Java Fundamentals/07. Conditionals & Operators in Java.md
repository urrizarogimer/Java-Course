# Conditionals and Operators
### Learning Objectives:
- Understand control flow using *if, else if, and else statements*
- Learn how to use comparison and logical operators in Java
- Differentiate between the assignment operator and comparison operators

In real life, we often make decisions based on conditions. Programming works the same way, **conditionals** allow a program to choose different paths depending on the situation. In Java, the most basic way to express this is through the if statement. You can use it to tell your program: **“If this condition is true, do this.”**

The basic syntax looks like this:
```java
if (condition) {
    // code that runs if the condition is true
}
```
For example:
```java
boolean isRaining = true;

if (isRaining) {
    System.out.println("Bring an umbrella.");
}
```

Only one block will execute in an if-else if-else chain: the first one where the condition is true. Once a match is found, the rest are skipped.

#### Comparison Operators
To build meaningful conditions, we use comparison operators, which evaluate values and return *true* or *false*. These include:

| Operator | Description           | Example    |
| -------- | --------------------- | ---------- |
| `==`     | Equal to              | `x == 5`   |
| `!=`     | Not equal to          | `x != 3`   |
| `>`      | Greater than          | `x > 10`   |
| `<`      | Less than             | `x < 10`   |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal | `x >= 5`   |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal    | `x <= 100` |

Be careful not to confuse the assignment operator = (which sets a value) with the comparison operator == (which checks for equality). For example:

```jave
int count = 1;      // assignment
count == 1;         // comparison, returns true
```

#### Logical Operators
Sometimes, you want to check multiple conditions at once. That’s where logical operators come in:

| Operator | Description                       | Example                                |                                |            |   |            |
| -------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------- | - | ---------- |
| `&&`     | AND – all conditions must be true | `age > 17 && age < 65`
|  | OR – at least one must be true | age < 13 | age > 65 |
| `!`      | NOT – reverses a condition        | `!(age < 18)` becomes true if age ≥ 18 |                                |            |   |            |

These operators let you combine or modify boolean expressions to write more complex logic.

*Example*
Try running the following example. Think about what you expect it to print before running it.
```java
public class ConditionalsAndOperators {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int temperature = 85;
        boolean isCloudy = true;

        if (temperature < 40 && isCloudy) {
            System.out.println("It might snow.");
        } else if (isCloudy) {
            System.out.println("It might rain.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("We should have nice weather today.");
        }
    }
}
```

Predict the output, then test it. Afterward, modify the temperature and isCloudy values and observe how the output changes. This is how you build intuition for conditionals and logic in Java.

#### Summary
Conditionals allow you to control the flow of execution in a program based on dynamic situations. With a clear understanding of how to write if, else if, and else statements—and how to use comparison and logical operators—you can write programs that make decisions just like we do in real life.
