## Student Scores Analyzer
#### Learning Objectives:
- Practice **declaring and initializing arrays** in Java
- Use **loops** to process and manipulate array data
- Apply **enhanced for-loops** for readability
- Differentiate between **fixed arrays** and **dynamic lists** (ArrayList)
- Understand **methods that take arrays as parameters** and return results
#### Difficulty: Intermediate
#### Estimated Time of Completion:1-2 hours
#### Instructions:

Your school has asked you to write a simple Java program that can help teachers **analyze student scores** for an exam. You will create a `ScoreUtil` class with **methods** to process arrays of scores and return useful statistics.

You will also create a **TestScores** class with a `main` method to test your code.

Create a new file **ScoreUtil.java** and implement the following methods:
1. double getAverageScore(int\[] scores)

    Given an array of integer scores, calculate and return the **average** score.
    - Use a **for loop** to sum all elements.
    - Return the result as a **double**.
2. int getHighestScore(int\[] scores)
    
    Return the **highest** score from the array.
    - Use either a **for loop** or **enhanced for loop** to find the maximum.

3. int getLowestScore(int\[] scores)
    
    Return the **lowest** score from the array.
    - Similar approach as the highest score but finding the minimum.

4. void printPassingScores(int\[] scores, int passingMark)

    Given the array of scores and a passing mark, **print all scores** that are greater than or equal to the passing mark.
    - Use a **for loop** and `if` statement.

5. int\[] getFailingScores(int\[] scores, int passingMark)
    
    Return a **new array** containing only the failing scores.
    - Use a **loop** to count failing scores, create a new array, and fill it.

#### Testing

Create **TestScores.java** with a `main` method.
1. Declare an integer array of at least **8 scores**.
2. Create an **instance** of your `ScoreUtil` class.
3. Call each method and print the results to verify correctness.

#### Sample Output:

```
----- Student Scores Analyzer -----
Scores: [85, 92, 78, 64, 99, 53, 87, 71]

Average Score: 78.625
Highest Score: 99
Lowest Score: 53

Passing Scores (>= 75):
85 92 78 99 87

Failing Scores (< 75):
64 53 71
```

#### Extramile

1. **Sort the scores** before printing them (ascending order).
2. Allow the user to **enter scores** using `Scanner` instead of hardcoding them.
3. Overload `printPassingScores` so it prints the count of passing students as well.
4. Create a method to **find the second highest score** without sorting.
