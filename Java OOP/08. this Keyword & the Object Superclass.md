Here’s a structured lesson flow for **this Keyword & Object Superclass** that follows the same style as your earlier lessons 👇

# 📘 Lesson: `this` Keyword & the `Object` Superclass

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students should be able to:

1. Understand and apply the **this keyword** in Java.
2. Differentiate between instance variables and parameter variables.
3. Apply constructor overloading using `this()`.
4. Recognize that every class in Java inherits from the **Object superclass**.
5. Use common methods inherited from the Object class (`getClass()`, `equals()`, `toString()`).

## 📝 Lesson Content

### 🔹 1. The `this` Keyword

* Refers to the **current object** of the class.
* Used to access:

  * Instance variables
  * Instance methods
  * Other constructors (via `this()`)

Example:

```java
class Person {
    private int age;
    private String name;

    public Person(int age, String name) {
        this.age = age;   // distinguish instance variable from parameter
        this.name = name;
    }
}
```

---

### 🔹 2. Why use `this`?

If constructor parameters have the same name as instance variables, `this` is required.

❌ Without `this`:

```java
public Person(int age, String name) {
    age = age;   // assigns local variable to itself (does nothing)
}
```

✅ With `this`:

```java
public Person(int age, String name) {
    this.age = age;
    this.name = name;
}
```

---

### 🔹 3. Constructor Overloading with `this()`

* One constructor can call another to avoid code duplication.
* Must be the **first statement** in the constructor.

```java
public class Person {
    private int age;
    private String name;
    private int cmHeight;

    public Person() {
        this(20, "John Doe", 171); // calls another constructor
    }

    public Person(int age, String name, int cmHeight) {
        this.age = age;
        this.name = name;
        this.cmHeight = cmHeight;
    }
}
```

---

### 🔹 4. The `Object` Superclass

* All classes in Java **implicitly extend Object**.
* Common inherited methods:

  * `getClass()` → returns the class of the object.
  * `equals(Object obj)` → compares objects.
  * `toString()` → returns a string representation.

Example:

```java
class Person {
    private int age;
    private String name;

    public Person(int age, String name) {
        this.age = age;
        this.name = name;
    }

    public void objectMethods(Person anotherObject) {
        System.out.println("Class name: " + this.getClass().getSimpleName());
        System.out.println("toString: " + this.toString());
        System.out.println("Equals: " + this.equals(anotherObject));
    }
}
```

Test:

```java
public class PersonTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person p1 = new Person(10, "Person1");
        Person p2 = new Person(5, "Person2");

        p1.objectMethods(p2);
    }
}
```

Output:

```
Class name: Person
toString: Person@7852e922
Equals: false
```

## 📌 Key Takeaways

* `this` is a reference to the **current object**.
* Use `this` to resolve naming conflicts and for constructor chaining.
* Every class in Java inherits from **Object superclass**.
* Object methods like `toString()` and `equals()` can be overridden for better readability and comparisons.
