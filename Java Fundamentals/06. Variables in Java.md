# Variables in Java
### Learning Objectives:

- Understand what a variable is and why we use it
- Learn how to declare and assign values to variables
- Distinguish between primitive and object data types
- Follow Java’s variable naming conventions

In Java, a **variable** is a container that stores data in memory so we can reuse and manipulate it later in our program. Think of a variable like a labeled box—you put something inside it (a value), and you refer to it by its label (the variable name) whenever you need that value.

To use a variable in Java, we first declare its type, then give it a name, and optionally assign it a value. This is required because Java is a statically-typed language, meaning it needs to know the type of every variable at the time of declaration. For example, int age = 25; declares a variable called age that stores an integer value.

You can also declare a variable first and assign its value later. For example:
```java
int number; // declaration
number = 10; // assignment
```

#### Types of Variables
Java has two main categories of data types: primitive types and object types.

*Primitive types* are the basic building blocks. These include:

- int – for whole numbers (e.g., 42)
- double – for decimal numbers (e.g., 3.14)
- boolean – for true/false values
- char – for single characters (e.g., 'A')

Each of these types uses a specific amount of memory and has a default value if uninitialized. For example, int defaults to 0, double to 0.0, and boolean to false.

**Object types**, on the other hand, are more complex. A common example is String, which is used to store text. Unlike primitives, object types offer built-in methods and functionality. For instance, you can call .length() on a String to find out how many characters it contains.

#### Variable Naming Conventions
To keep your code readable and professional, follow these naming conventions:

- Variable names should be descriptive, like userAge or totalAmount, not just a or x.
- Use camelCase: start with a lowercase letter, and capitalize each new word (e.g., firstName, amountCollected).
- Avoid Java’s reserved keywords like int, class, or boolean as variable names.
- Don’t begin a variable name with a number or include special characters like spaces.

#### Code Example
```java
public class Variables {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        int age = 20;
        double price = 99.99;
        boolean isAvailable = true;
        char grade = 'A';
        String name = "Rogie";

        System.out.println("Name: " + name);
        System.out.println("Age: " + age);
        System.out.println("Grade: " + grade);
    }
}
```
In this example, we've declared and initialized variables of several types and printed them using System.out.println().

#### Summary
Variables are the foundation of any Java program. By choosing clear names, declaring types correctly, and understanding how primitive and object types differ, you’ll write more reliable and maintainable code. As you continue, you’ll see how variables interact with other concepts like methods, loops, and classes to build complete applications.
