## Debugging in Java
#### Learning Objective
- Students will **use print statements to check and debug their code** and learn how to trace program flow to identify logic errors.


Debugging is a vital skill for every programmer. As you write more complex Java programs using **conditionals**, **loops**, and **methods**, you’ll encounter bugs that are not always obvious. While professional developers often use advanced debugging tools, beginners can start with one of the simplest but most effective techniques: **strategic print statements**.

#### Scenario

You’ve been asked to write a program that removes all snacks starting with the letter **A** from a shopping list. Sounds simple, right? But when you run the code… something strange happens. Let’s walk through the debugging process together.


#### The Buggy Code

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Loops {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        ArrayList<String> snacks = new ArrayList<String>();
        snacks.add("Apples");
        snacks.add("Almonds");
        snacks.add("Pretzels");
        snacks.add("Yogurt");

        System.out.println(snacks);

        for(int i = 0; i < snacks.size(); i++) {
            if(snacks.get(i).charAt(0) == 'A') {
                snacks.remove(i);
            }
        }

        System.out.println(snacks);
    }
}
```

Expected Output:

```
[Pretzels, Yogurt]
```

Actual Output:

```
[Almonds, Pretzels, Yogurt]
```

#### Step 1: Use a Print Statement to See What’s Happening

We’ll place a print statement **inside the if-statement** to see when we’re removing an item.

```java
for(int i = 0; i < snacks.size(); i++) {
    if(snacks.get(i).charAt(0) == 'A') {
        System.out.println("Removing: " + snacks.get(i));
        snacks.remove(i);
    }
}
```

Output:

```
[Apples, Almonds, Pretzels, Yogurt]
Removing: Apples
[Almonds, Pretzels, Yogurt]
```

We can see that **Apples** is removed… but **Almonds** remains.


#### Step 2: Add Another Print Statement Before the If-Statement

This will help us trace **which snack is being checked at each loop iteration**.

```java
for(int i = 0; i < snacks.size(); i++) {
    System.out.println("Checking index " + i + ": " + snacks.get(i));
    if(snacks.get(i).charAt(0) == 'A') {
        System.out.println("Removing: " + snacks.get(i));
        snacks.remove(i);
    }
}
```

Output:

```
[Apples, Almonds, Pretzels, Yogurt]
Checking index 0: Apples
Removing: Apples
Checking index 1: Pretzels
Checking index 2: Yogurt
[Almonds, Pretzels, Yogurt]
```

**Aha!**
When we remove **Apples** at index `0`, all the items shift left — so **Almonds** takes index `0` but we never check it because the loop moves to index `1`.

#### Step 3: Adjust the Loop to Check Every Item

The fix: after removing an item, move the index back by 1 so the next loop iteration will re-check the new value at the current position.

```java
for(int i = 0; i < snacks.size(); i++) {
    if(snacks.get(i).charAt(0) == 'A') {
        snacks.remove(i);
        i--; // step back to re-check current index
    }
}
```

Final Output:

```
[Pretzels, Yogurt]
```

#### Key Takeaways

* Print statements help you **see the program flow** step-by-step.
* Removing elements from a list while iterating can cause **index shifting problems**.
* Adjusting the loop counter (`i--`) ensures you don’t skip any items.
* Always **remove temporary debug prints** after fixing your code.


#### Practice Challenge

Try modifying the program so that:

1. It removes all snacks starting with **P** instead.
2. It works for lowercase and uppercase letters (hint: use `.toLowerCase()` when checking).
