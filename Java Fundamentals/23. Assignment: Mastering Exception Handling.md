## Casting Chaos – Mastering Exception Handling**
#### Objective

Practice implementing **exception handling** in Java by working with **ArrayLists**, **generics**, and **type casting**. Learn how to gracefully handle runtime errors and keep your program running even when unexpected data types appear.
#### Difficulty:Intermediate
#### Estimated Time of Completion: 25–40 minutes

#### Scenario

Your new Project Manager has heard that you’re still sharpening your Java skills. As a fun challenge, she wants you to **intentionally break the code**—and then fix it using exception handling.

You will create an **ArrayList** containing both numbers and strings. Then, you’ll attempt to cast each element into an integer. Naturally, this will cause some **ClassCastException** errors. Your mission is to **catch those exceptions** and report exactly what went wrong.

#### Instructions

1. **Create an ArrayList** that stores mixed data (numbers and strings).

   ```java
   ArrayList<Object> myList = new ArrayList<Object>();
   myList.add("13");
   myList.add("hello world");
   myList.add(48);
   myList.add("Goodbye World");
   ```

2. **Loop through the ArrayList** and attempt to cast each element to an `Integer`.

   ```java
   for (int i = 0; i < myList.size(); i++) {
       Integer castedValue = (Integer) myList.get(i); // This will cause trouble!
   }
   ```

3. **Add exception handling** with `try` and `catch` so that:

   * The program **does not crash** when an error occurs.
   * You print out:

     * The **error message**
     * The **index** where the error happened
     * The **offending value** from the ArrayList

4. **Ensure the program continues running** even after an exception is caught.


#### Expected Output Example

*(Exact formatting may vary)*

```
Error: java.lang.ClassCastException
At index: 0
Offending value: 13

Error: java.lang.ClassCastException
At index: 1
Offending value: hello world

Value at index 2 is: 48

Error: java.lang.ClassCastException
At index: 3
Offending value: Goodbye World
```
