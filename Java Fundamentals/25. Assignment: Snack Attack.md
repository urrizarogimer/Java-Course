## Snack Attack
#### Learning Objective
- Use **print statements** to trace program execution and identify logic errors in Java. Learn how to adjust your loop logic to ensure that all intended items are removed from a list.

#### Difficulty: Beginner–Intermediate
#### Estimated Time of Completion:20–30 minutes
#### Scenario

You’ve been tasked with cleaning up a snack list by removing all snacks that start with the letter **A**. Sounds easy… until you run your code and find that **not all “A” snacks are removed**. Your mission is to **debug the program** using **print statements** to figure out what’s going wrong and fix it.

#### Instructions

1. **Create an ArrayList** of snacks:

   ```java
   ArrayList<String> snacks = new ArrayList<String>();
   snacks.add("Apples");
   snacks.add("Almonds");
   snacks.add("Pretzels");
   snacks.add("Yogurt");
   ```

2. **Write a loop** that removes any snack whose name starts with `A`.
   Example starting loop:

   ```java
   for (int i = 0; i < snacks.size(); i++) {
       if (snacks.get(i).charAt(0) == 'A') {
           snacks.remove(i);
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Run the program** and observe the **unexpected output**.

4. **Add print statements** to:

   * Show **which index** and **snack** is being checked in each iteration.
   * Show when a snack is **removed** from the list.

5. **Analyze the printed output** to figure out **why some “A” snacks are being skipped**.

6. **Modify your loop** so that **no snacks are skipped** when removing items.
   *Hint:* Adjust the loop counter after removal.

7. **Test again** until your program removes all “A” snacks correctly.

#### Expected Output Example

*(Your exact formatting may vary.)*

```
[Apples, Almonds, Pretzels, Yogurt]
Checking index 0: Apples
Removing: Apples
Checking index 1: Pretzels
Checking index 2: Yogurt
[Almonds, Pretzels, Yogurt]  <-- Bug: Almonds not removed!
```

After fixing:

```
[Apples, Almonds, Pretzels, Yogurt]
Checking index 0: Apples
Removing: Apples
Checking index 0: Almonds
Removing: Almonds
Checking index 1: Yogurt
[Pretzels, Yogurt]  <-- Success!
```

#### Bonus Challenge

1. Change the code so it removes snacks starting with **P** instead.
2. Make it case-insensitive so it works for both uppercase and lowercase snack names.
