## Member Variables
#### Learning Objective:
- Define and use **member variables (attributes/fields)** inside a class to represent object data.

In the previous lesson, we learned that **methods** are actions (behaviors) of a class. Now, let‚Äôs explore how we can group **data** together inside a class using **member variables**.

* **Methods** = what an object can do.
* **Member variables** = what an object *knows* (its attributes).

Together, they make classes more powerful and help us build **custom data types**.

#### Related Functionality in One Place

Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre creating a program to manage **Books in a Library**.

```java
class LibraryHelper {
    public void displayWelcome() {
        System.out.println("üìö Welcome to the Library System!");
    }

    public void showBookRecommendation() {
        System.out.println("We recommend: 'Clean Code' by Robert C. Martin.");
    }
}
```

Now, if you create a `LibraryHelper` object:

```java
LibraryHelper helper = new LibraryHelper();
helper.displayWelcome();
helper.showBookRecommendation();
```

* All related methods belong to **one class**.
* You access them with **dot notation**.

This is the same way **member variables** work‚Äîexcept instead of methods, you‚Äôre accessing stored **data**.

#### Custom Data Types

Java lets us create our own **data types** with both:

* **Member variables (fields)** ‚Üí store object data
* **Methods** ‚Üí manipulate that data

For example:

```java
String[] fruits = {"peach", "mango", "banana"};
System.out.println("Length: " + fruits.length);

ArrayList<Integer> nums = new ArrayList<>();
nums.add(42);
```

Here:

* `add()` is a **method** of `ArrayList`.
* `length` is a **member variable** of arrays.

üëâ Anytime you use **dot notation** (`arr.length`, `nums.add()`), you are working with **OOP concepts**.

**Types of Variables in a Class**

1. **Member variables (fields):**

   * Attributes that belong to the object.
   * Persist as long as the object exists.

2. **Local variables:**

   * Declared inside methods.
   * Temporary (exist only while the method runs).

3. **Parameter variables:**

   * Declared in method headers.
   * Temporary, only valid during method execution.

In Java, ‚Äúmember variables,‚Äù ‚Äúfields,‚Äù ‚Äúattributes,‚Äù ‚Äúproperties,‚Äù and ‚Äúinstance variables‚Äù all mean the same thing.

*Example: Car Class*

```java
class Car {
    public int year;
    public String make;
    public String model;
    public String color;
}
```

Here, `year`, `make`, `model`, and `color` are **member variables**.

#### Using Member Variables

```java
class CarTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        // Create first car object
        Car client1Car = new Car();
        client1Car.year = 2001;
        client1Car.make = "Honda";
        client1Car.model = "Civic";
        client1Car.color = "White";
        
        // Create second car object
        Car client2Car = new Car();
        client2Car.year = 2018;
        client2Car.make = "Mazda";
        client2Car.model = "CX-3";
        client2Car.color = "Navy";
        
        // Access member variables with dot notation
        System.out.println("Car 1: " + client1Car.make + " " + client1Car.model);
        System.out.println("Car 2: " + client2Car.make + " " + client2Car.model);
    }
}
```

*Output:*

```
Car 1: Honda Civic
Car 2: Mazda CX-3
```

Each object has its own **unique data**, stored in its member variables.

#### Practice Exercise

1. Create a class `Book` with member variables: `title`, `author`, `yearPublished`.
2. In `BookTest`, create **two book objects** and assign values.
3. Print each book‚Äôs details using `System.out.println()`.

#### Summary

* **Member variables** store object attributes (data).
* Each object has its own **copy of member variables**.
* You access them using **dot notation**.
* Java classes can also contain **local** and **parameter** variables.
