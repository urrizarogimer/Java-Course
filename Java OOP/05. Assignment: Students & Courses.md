## Students & Courses
#### Learning Objectives:
- Use another class file to help store data in a more organized way
- Understand the value of grouping related data inside a class
- Set **member variables** inside a class file
- Instantiate objects from classes to simulate real-world data management

#### Difficulty: Intermediate
#### Estimated Time of Completion: 60-90 minutes
#### Instructions

We’re going to simulate a **School Enrollment System**. You will create two classes — `Course` and `Student` — and then a testing file `TestSchool` to demonstrate how objects can store and manipulate data.

**Step 1: Create `Course` class**

Member variables:

```java
String courseName  
String courseCode  
int units  
```

**Step 2: Create `Student` class**

Member variables:

```java
String name  
int age  
ArrayList<Course> courses  
boolean enrolled  
```

**Step 3: Create a testing file `TestSchool`**

Inside the `main` method:

1. **Create 4 Course objects** (`course1`, `course2`, `course3`, `course4`) with the following:

   * course1: "Introduction to Java", "CS101", 3 units
   * course2: "Database Systems", "CS202", 4 units
   * course3: "Web Development", "CS303", 3 units
   * course4: "Mobile App Development", "CS404", 4 units

2. **Create 3 Student objects** (`student1`, `student2`, `student3`) with the following names:

   * "Alice" (age 19)
   * "Bob" (age 20)
   * "Charlie" (age 18)

3. **Enroll students in courses:**

   * Alice → Java + Web Development
   * Bob → Database Systems + Mobile App Development
   * Charlie → All 4 courses

4. Print out each student’s name and their enrolled courses using a loop.

5. Set `student1.enrolled = true;` (Alice is now officially enrolled). Print confirmation.

6. Add another course (`Database Systems`) to Alice’s record. Update her course list.

7. Change Bob’s enrollment status to **true** and print his details.

8. Remove one course from Charlie’s record (drop "Web Development"). Update and print his new list.

**Example Snippet**

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class TestSchool {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example: Creating courses
        Course course1 = new Course();
        course1.courseName = "Introduction to Java";
        course1.courseCode = "CS101";
        course1.units = 3;

        // Example: Creating students
        Student student1 = new Student();
        student1.name = "Alice";
        student1.age = 19;
        student1.courses = new ArrayList<Course>();
        student1.enrolled = false;

        // Add courses to Alice
        student1.courses.add(course1);
        System.out.println(student1.name + " enrolled in: " + student1.courses.get(0).courseName);
    }
}
```
#### Expected Practice Outcomes
- Define and use **member variables** inside classes.
- Create multiple objects from the same class (students, courses).
- Update and manipulate object data with **dot notation**.
- Simulate **real-world applications** (enrollment system).
